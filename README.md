## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is a personal collection of:
- 🧠 **Practice exercises** to strengthen my fundamentals  
- 💻 **Mini projects** that combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- ⚙️ **Intermediate and advanced projects** to apply real-world concepts  
- 🎨 **UI experiments** and **DOM manipulation** practice  

Each project folder includes its own HTML, CSS, and JS files, and sometimes a short README explaining the logic or goal of that project.
