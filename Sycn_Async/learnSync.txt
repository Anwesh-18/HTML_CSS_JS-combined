Java is a single threaded engine.
Js engine only contains heap memory and call stack

Synchronous work: Does the ordered work and dont let us do anything else untill the work is done. 
Asynchronous work: Does the ordered work and let us do anything else untill the work is done then push the result we need once its done.

Synchronous is Blocking And Asynchronous is Non-Blocking.

Call Stack function calls the web Api (while Asynchronous) and goes into the Task queue to get implemented and after the required time it gets implemented.
Another queue is used for functions like fetch() known as Promise Queue or task queue which does the same work just having a high priority.
